# [AlzAid](https://devpost.com/software/alzaid-alzheimer-s-assistant) - Best Web Security App and Best Pitch at [LaunchHacksI](https://launchhacks.tech/)!

## Inspiration

AlzAid is a revolutionary new software assistant specifically designed to help people with Alzheimer’s disease, memory loss, and/or dementia. AlzAid enables people to quickly identify the faces of their friends and loved ones, using a computerized application that employs face recognition technology to assist the user. AlzAid is a web-based app that can be deployed as a system boarded onto a multitude of portable devices such as a wristband.

## What it does

AlzAid’s platform has two main parts. First, there is the web-based app where users can register and sign in to their personal account. Here, they can manage their close contacts by uploading the images and identities of their loved ones. Second, there is the portable assistant that helps users recognize and store the faces and identities of their loved ones before memory loss sets in. Then, if users forget the identity of a person, they can use the app to quickly identify them and remind the user thereof.

## How we built it

AlzAid was created using Python, specifically the Flask web server. We also used OpenCV’s camera interfacing and face recognition API to help us recognize the faces of users and their loved ones. We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the web server.

## Challenges we ran into

We were initially confused as to the proper structure of the project folders. The server directory tree of users and faces in particular was quite complicated. We also needed to seamlessly integrate face-recognition with a web-browser environment, which required advanced knowledge of OpenCV.

## What's next for AlzAid

AlzAid is ready to be deployed on any number of hand-held devices. Phones, iPads, and even Raspberry Pi’s can interface with AlzAid, thus creating a portable assistant that’s always there to help those struggling with Alzheimer’s.
